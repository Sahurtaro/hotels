The Hotels API allows our users to create and add all the relevant information for hotel owners to show on a page built to promote their services.

Getting started
To start using the ((add APIs here)), you need to ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

nodemon
